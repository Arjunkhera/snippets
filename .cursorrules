# Cursor AI Rules

## File Organization

- **NEVER** create summary files, progress reports, changelogs, validation reports, or similar AI-generated working documentation at the root level of the project.
- **ALWAYS** place such files in the `/Cursor` directory to keep the workspace clean and organized.
- Examples of files that belong in `/Cursor`:
  - CHANGELOG_*.md (e.g., CHANGELOG_REFACTORING.md)
  - VALIDATION_*.md (e.g., VALIDATION_REPORT.md)
  - FIXES_*.md
  - PROGRESS_*.md
  - SUMMARY_*.md
  - Any other temporary or session-specific documentation files
- Exception: User-facing documentation like README.md, LICENSE, and project-specific docs in designated folders (PRDs/, Prompts/, etc.) should remain in their appropriate locations.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: CONDA ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENT

**ALWAYS activate the conda environment 'testing' before running ANY commands, tests, or development tasks:**

```bash
conda activate testing
```

**This project MUST use the 'testing' conda environment to avoid conflicts with global pip installations.**

### Environment Setup Rules

1. **Before running any Python commands:**
   - Always check if conda environment 'testing' is active
   - If not active, activate it with `conda activate testing`
   - Verify with `echo $CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV` (should show 'testing')

2. **Before running tests:**
   - Ensure conda environment 'testing' is active
   - Run pytest or other test commands within this environment

3. **Before installing packages:**
   - Always use `conda install` or `pip install` within the 'testing' environment
   - Never install to global Python environment

### Key Commands

```bash
# Activate environment (REQUIRED)
conda activate testing

# Run tests
pytest

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Deactivate when done
conda deactivate
```

### Important Notes

- This project uses conda for environment management
- Global pip installations will cause conflicts
- Always verify environment before running commands
- Use the 'testing' conda environment for all development work
